# CycleGear

> AI-Powered Cycling Assistant for Road Cyclists

CycleGear is a modern web application designed to solve two critical problems for road cyclists: choosing the right outfit for current weather conditions and systematically managing bike maintenance. The system uses artificial intelligence for personalized recommendations and learns individual thermal preferences based on feedback after each training session.

## Project Description

CycleGear helps road cyclists make confident decisions about what to wear before every ride and keep their bikes in optimal condition through intelligent maintenance tracking.

### Key Features

#### üå§Ô∏è Intelligent Outfit Assistant
- AI-powered outfit recommendations for 7 body zones (head, torso, arms, hands, legs, feet, neck)
- Real-time weather data integration from OpenWeather API
- Personalized thermal profile based on user feedback
- Interactive SVG cyclist visualization showing recommended layers
- 7-day weather forecast with quick outfit suggestions
- History of proven outfits for similar conditions

#### üë• Local Community
- Share your outfit choices with nearby cyclists (within 50km radius)
- Browse what others are wearing in similar weather conditions
- Reputation system based on feedback count (Novice, Regular, Expert, Master)
- Anonymized data sharing for privacy

#### üö¥ Equipment Management
- Track multiple bikes with detailed service history
- Smart maintenance reminders based on mileage intervals
- Cost monitoring and analysis (cost/km, breakdown by category)
- Service dashboard with upcoming and overdue maintenance alerts
- CSV export for record keeping

#### üéØ Smart Personalization
- Thermal adjustment algorithm learns from your feedback
- Activity type customization (recovery, easy, tempo, intervals)
- Duration-based recommendations (<1h, 1-2h, 2-3h, >3h)
- Minimum 5 feedbacks to activate full personalization

### Unique Value Proposition

- **AI-Powered Personalization**: Every user has a unique thermal profile
- **Community Learning**: Learn from local cycling community
